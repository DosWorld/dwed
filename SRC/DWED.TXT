///1ABOUT
        About ~DWED~.

~DWED~ is a fullfeatured multifile text-editor with
cliboard and syntax highlight support.

You can use ~DWED~ as ~IDE~ for programming.

Designed for ~IBM-XT~-grade PC with Intel ~8086~/~88~ CPU
and works in Real Mode ~without~ DPMI, but support editing
up to ~2G~ files.

///1INTERNALS
        Few tricks.

1. Some time, editor ask you something like

        ~Can i do %something%? (Y/N)~

In this case, you can press ~Y~ or ~ENTER~ - to answer ~YES~
and ~N~ or ~ESC~ - to answer ~NO~.

2. For micro-instalation need only two files: ~DWED.EXE~ and
   ~DWEDOVL.EXE~.

3. You can store ~DWED.CFG~ in local dir, also.

4. You can disable highlight, if too slow (see ~SYNTAX-HL~).

5. You can use ~dos~ memory or ~swap~ memory (but it more slow).
   See ~EXT-MEMORY~.

~Alt~+~F6~  - Opened File list window.

~Alt~+~F4~  - Close file

~Alt~+~F5~  - Show DOS screen.
///1SYNTAX-HL
        Syntax ~h~i~g~h~l~i~g~h~t~.

~DWED~ support syntax highlight for next languages:

~Assembler~   .asm
~Sphinx C--~  .c-- .h-- .cmm .hmm
~Pascal~      .pas
~Basic~       .bas
~C~/~C++~       .c .h .cpp .hpp
~XML/HTML~    .xml .htm

 and ~MS-DOS Shell Scripting~ .bat

~Ctrl~+~Alt~+~H~ - to change highlight scheme.

You can disable highlight, by default, with config option:
        ~hl.enable~ = 0
///1CMD-LINE
        Command-line parameters magic.

If you want load few file - you can specify all of them
into command line.

You can also pass some configuration parameters. For
example if you have line into ~DWED.CFG~ like this:

        abc ~=~ 4

You can pass this value via command-line:

        ~DWED.EXE~ ~/~abc~=~4
or
        ~DWED.EXE~ ~-~abc~=~4
///1RUN_USR_SHELL
        Run user's shell scripts.

To run user's shell scripts used keys ~F5~, ~F8~, ~F9~.
To configure actions, put into ~DWED.CFG~ lines like:

~usr.def.f5~ = %COMSPEC%
~usr.def.f8~ = make all
~usr.def.f9~ = make run
///1EXT-MEMORY
        Ex~t~ended (XMS) ~/~ Ex~p~anded (EMS) memory.

~DWED~ use ~XMS~/~EMS~ for cache only (1-2M). But if you want use
full memory - you can do it in indirect way. Just point
your ~TMP~ directory to RamDisk and choose ~swap~ memory.

Memory model could be configured via config setting:

~memory~ = dos~|~swap~

   Values:

~dos~     - Use ~MS-DOS~ conventional memory. Fast.
          IRL up to ~350K~.
~swap~    - Temporary files as string storage (with or
          without ~EMS~/~XMS~ cache). In theory, up to ~2G~.
          Require free space into ~TMP~ (or ~TEMP~) dir.

At the same time, you can specify one option only.
By default, value - ~dos~.

///1ADDONS
You can active Addons window with ~Alt~+~F10~ or ~F12~.
///2FASTKBD.COM
        Fast keyboard.

Keyboard works not so fast, because have a big delay into
type metrics. ~AT-BIOS~ allow change it.

By my opinion, this is not task for text-editor - this is
environment settings.

So, if you want decrease this delay - you can use next
~FASTKBD.COM~ file into your ~AUTOEXEC.BAT~:

0100: ~B8 05 03~  mov  ax~,~ 0305h
0103: ~31 DB~     xor  bx~,~ bx
0105: ~CD 16~     int  16h
0107: ~C3~        ret
///2TETRIS
        ~Tetris~ (Video-Game)

Every text-editor ~must have~ a buildin Tetris. ~TBD~
///1CONFIG
        Config file

~DWED~ have config file ~DWED.CFG~. At first, try to
load from current dir and then - from dir with ~DWED.EXE~.
File format is text - ~key~=~value~ in each line.

Colors is coded as hex. For example:

        ~color.text~ = ~70~

it is mean ~7~ - foreground color and ~0~ - background.
///2ALL_OPTIONS
        All configuration options.

~hl.enable~ = 1
~memory~ = dos~|~swap~    (see ~EXT-MEMORY~)
~tab_size~ = 8
~color.top~ = 70
~color.top_hl~ = 74
~color.text~ = 07
~color.text_hl~ = 03
~color.text_dl~ = 08
~color.text_sel~ = 17
~color.menu~ = 1b
~color.menu_sel~ = 30
~color.help_menu~ = 07
~color.help_menu_sel~ = 70
~color.help~ = 07
~color.help_hl~ = 03
~usr.def.f5~ = make clean
~usr.def.f8~ = make all
~usr.def.f9~ = make run
