///2FASTKBD.COM
        Fast keyboard.

Keyboard works not so fast, because have a big delay into
type metrics. ~AT-BIOS~ allow change it.

By my opinion, this is not task for text-editor - this is
environment settings.

So, if you want decrease this delay - you can use next
~FASTKBD.COM~ file into your ~AUTOEXEC.BAT~:

0100: ~B8 05 03~  mov  ax~,~ 0305h
0103: ~31 DB~     xor  bx~,~ bx
0105: ~CD 16~     int  16h
0107: ~C3~        ret
