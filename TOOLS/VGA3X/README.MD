# VGA3x

Here are two resident programs that allow forcibly set VGA adapters
to 30-line mode when trying to install via BIOS 2nd or 3rd video mode.

VGA3x - checks the video mode setting, and if the 2nd or 3rd one is set,
then independently sets the 30(34) line mode using VGA ports.

When writing this program, the source code of the program was used
VGA480 by Dmitry Gurtyak.

Ways of changing the source texts to change the inline modes are
indicated in the comments.
